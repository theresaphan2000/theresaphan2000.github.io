It was really one of the first "official" projects I started, and though it is not perfect I still learned a lot from it. For this, I designed a basic
                            mechanical keyboard from bare bone AVR chips, along with designing a Python application that made remapping the keymaps easier.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Alegreya Sans', sans-serif;color: rgb(162,162,162);background-color: #131722;">A basic keyboard that is typically sold to the common audience is extremely limiting in its customization. Usually, the product is sold with a preset keymapping layout that either is completely unchangeable or can be altered to
                            one’s preference but requires intermediate levels of programming in C, AVRDUDE firmware flashing, and at least a general understanding of MCUS and data charts. Because of this, most keyboard users have no access to customizations
                            that<br>cater to their preferences and/or ways to efficiently boost their productivity.With that, the intentions in developing this project was to simplify the process of reprogramming and flashing firmware onto a keyboard.
                            To do so, I decided to build a small 3x3 dynamic macro-pad with fully customizable keys that can both be static, or dynamically macro. Alongside that, I developed a basic GUI Python application that significantly simplified
                            the process of making the<br>hex file and flashing the file onto the MCU itself. Consequently, the user then does not need to know C or Bash Script, how to navigate the terminal, or have to read through countless articles and
                            accidently brick their MCU.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p style="font-family: 'Alegreya Sans', sans-serif;color: rgb(162,162,162);background-color: #131722;">Throughout the term, I had many goals and milestones I wanted to reach for this project, such as:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Successfully wiping the Arduino bootloader from the ATMEGA328p chip.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Rewriting the firmware to fit for specifications for customized keyboard<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Flashing firmware onto the ATMEGA328P chip.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Prototyping a hardwired keyboard.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Prototyping a GUI Python application that can allow users to change macros, make and<br>&nbsp;
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;compile the file, along with flashing.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Custom PCB for the keyboard <br>Though some of these goasl were not compelete,
                            I will go into more detail about the parts I was able to compelete.&nbsp;<br></p>

This
                                            was rather difficult because it was the first time I've worked with a baremetal chip other than PIC processors. What I needed to do was use AVRdude to flash the USBaspLoader that allowed the MCU to be an HID.
                                            The first few times, I had difficulty making this work because I wasn't doing it in command line, and was doing this in the Ubuntu terminal instead which caused targetting errors. To wipe and reupload a new
                                            bootloader, I had to use the USBtiny pocket programmer to achieve this.&nbsp;</td>

This was a simple process, as all I needed were a few capacitors and a 16MHz crystal oscillator.

I had to configure my firmware to the atmega328p and rewrite the keymapping for the board. Getting the firmware
                                            onto the board was a lot simplier than the bootloader, as I had more experience with flashing MCU's at this point.&nbsp;</td>
